Backend development focuses on the server-side of web applications. 

It is responsible for managing databases, handling requests from the frontend, and ensuring the application runs smoothly.

How Backend Works

Client Sends a Request

A user interacts with a website or mobile app (frontend).
The frontend sends a request to the backend (e.g., asking for user data).
Backend Processes the Request

The server receives the request.
It may communicate with a database or perform calculations.
Backend Sends a Response

The processed data is sent back to the frontend.
The frontend displays the result to the user.
